            <p class="minor">A potato chip is a thin slice of potato that has been either deep fried, baked, or air fried until crunchy. They are commonly served as a snack, side dish, or appetizer. The basic chips are cooked and salted; additional varieties are manufactured using various flavorings and ingredients including herbs, spices, cheeses, other natural flavors, artificial flavors, and additives.</p>

        <h2>How to make chips at home?</h2>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 large floury potatoes, such as Maris Piper, King Edward, Desirée (about 1.6kg)</li>
            <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tsp celery salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oven to 200℃. Peel the potatoes and cut them into long chip shapes – the thickness is entirely up to you, though the width of a finger is ideal. Rinse under the cold tap and pat dry with a tea towel.</li>
            <li>Spread the chips on a large non-stick baking tray and toss with the olive oil and celery salt. Lie them flat in a single layer – use two trays rather than overcrowd one.</li>
            <li>Roast for 45-50 mins, turning now and then. When cooked they should be golden brown and crisp with a light fluffy centre. Scatter on sea salt to serve.</li>
        </ol>
