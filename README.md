# HTML Demo

This project is a webpage: [Demo](https://bubbu0129.github.io/HTML-Demo/).

I opt to build the site from scratch so as to practise my web-dev skills, so it may look primitive and kinda dumb.

PS: I referred to the instructions on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn" rel="nofollow"> MDN Web Docs</a>.
