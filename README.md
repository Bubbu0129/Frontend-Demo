This project is a webpage: https://crisper-dong.github.io/blog. 
At this stage, it's just a primitive version, which doesn't looks like a blog at all. 
I opt to build the site from scratch as I get to learn HTML to practise my web-dev skills. 

I refer to the instructions on MDN https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn.
