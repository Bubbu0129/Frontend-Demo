# Personal Blog
This project is a webpage: <a href="https://crisper-dong.github.io/blog" rel="nofollow">https://crisper-dong.github.io/blog</a>.
At this stage, it's just a primitive version, which doesn't looks like a blog at all. I opt to build the site from scratch so as to practise my web-dev skills.</p>
PS: I referred to the instructions on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn" rel="nofollow"> MDN Web Docs</a>.
