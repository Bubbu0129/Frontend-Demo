# A-Primitive-Personal-Website
This project is a html webpage: https://crisper-dong.github.io/A-Primitive-Personal-Website/. 
I refer to the instructions on MDN https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn, and create this personal site to practise my web-dev skills. 
This project will be developed continuously until I finish the tutorial on MDN.
